# Discord Code Help Challenges

This repo contains my solutions to the challenges in the [Coding Help server on Discord](https://codinghelp.site).

I'm gonna try to make these solutions diverse, using different languages and trying some unusual approaches to solving them.
Have fun looking through them!



### Challenges

- [Challenge 1](./src/challenge1.hs)
> Ask a user for a word, then reverse that word and show it to them. You can write this in any coding language you'd like. Just let us know what language when you submit the answer.
