# Discord Code Help Challenges

This repo contains my solutions to the challenges in the [Coding Help server on Discord](https://codinghelp.site).

I'm gonna try to make these solutions diverse, using different languages and trying some unusual approaches to solving them.
Have fun looking through them!



## Challenges

#### [Challenge 1](./src/challenge1.hs)
> Ask a user for a word, then reverse that word and show it to them. You can write this in any coding language you'd like. Just let us know what language when you submit the answer.

#### [Challenge 2](./src/challenge2.md)
> Create a HTML/CSS Webpage that prints a joke when someone clicks a button. You can use JS, PHP, Python, whatever. The code just has to work on a HTML/CSS webpage. BONUS POINTS OPPORTUNITY: The fancier you make it (and funnier the jokes) the more points you get.

#### [Challenge 3](./src/challenge3.md)
> Create the popular challenge FizzBuzz, If you don't know what this is, you can read [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) - A bonus point will be awarded to the best submission!

#### [Challenge 4](./src/challenge4)
> Create a tic-tac-toe game that we, mods, can interact with and display a custom message if we win or lose. BONUS POINTS: Users that can display the number of games won for the bot/computer and user for us to see when we run the game will receive an extra bonus point! Best looking one also receives 1 bonus point. So you can get up to 2 bonus points this week!
