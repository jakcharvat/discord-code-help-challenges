## SocketChat

#### Prompt

> Create a real-time chat application using node. Everything else is allowed (for example clients connecting via command line or via an html page ...) Suggestion for people who're not sure how to start: use socket.io (their tutorial is a chat application). 2 bonus points will be given: 1 to the submission with best / most beautiful layout and 1 to the submission with the coolest extra features.

> :warning: **Note:** This is deployed as a server on Heroku. I only have a free Heroku account, so it will go to sleep after a while. This will clear the data, and will take a while to boot back up. You can also just run the server locally. 

#### Source code

The source code for the whole site is located in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/jakcharvat/socketchat/).
